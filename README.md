> [!NOTE]
> If you don't put the `user.js` file in your profile folder, please set the following settings to `true` in your `about:config` tab if you want this css to work properly:
> 
> `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
> 
> `svg.context-properties.content.enabled`
> 
> `layout.css.has-selector.enabled`

> [!TIP]
> If you have an issue, please report it here in the issues tab instead of somewhere else like reddit, it makes finding and fixing the issue faster
