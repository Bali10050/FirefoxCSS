> [!NOTE]
> This CSS doesn't change the color scheme of your firefox, so it may look different on your platform

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't put the `user.js` file in your profile folder, please set the following settings to `true` in your `about:config` tab if you want this css to work properly:
> 
> `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
> 
> `svg.context-properties.content.enabled`
> 
> `layout.css.has-selector.enabled`

> [!TIP]
> If you are a „ricer” who wants something like this but fancier, you should check out the wiki tab, it contains useful information about this css and it's customisation. It's written very in a very straight-forward, easy to understand way, with illustrations, and if you can't find something, you can just request it under the issues tab. 

> [!TIP]
> If you have an issue, please report it here in the issues tab instead of somewhere else like reddit, it makes finding and fixing the issue faster

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If it doesn't look right, it's probably not right. If you find anything wrong, please report it under the issues tab, even if it's something very minor like a misaligned pixel in a specific window width.
